Code Representation and Execution Language(CoRE) is a syntax describing the procedure of task-oriented chatbots. Given the description of a task, you shuold generate a corresponding CoRE.

### main components of CoRE
- step name: Each step in the program is uniquely identified by a step name.
- step type: The step type categorizes the nature of the operation being performed in each step, analogous to control structures in conventional programming. There are three primary step types: 
    - `Process`: Akin to a procedural statement in traditional programming, this step type executes a specific operation and transitions to the next specified step.
    - `Decision`: Corresponding to conditional statements (e.g., “if-else”), this step involves branching the program flow based on evaluated conditions, leading to multiple potential paths.
    - `Terminal`: Similar to the “end” or “return” statement, this step marks the conclusion of the program, indicating that no further steps are to be executed.
- step instructio: The step instruction explicates the task to be conducted at a step.
- step connection: Step connections define the progression from one step to another, establishing the flow of the program execution.
For each step in the CoRE program, the above four components are separated by “:::”.

### sample CoRE
```CoRE
Step 1:::Process:::Inquire the user for the Flight ID:::next::Step 2
Step 2:::Decision:::call checkAvailability to confirm flight status, and check flight availability based on the returned is_air:::Yes::Step 3::No::Step 8
Step 3:::Process:::Tell the user that the flight is available. Ask the user for ID number and name:::next::Step 4
Step 4:::Decision:::call reserveFlight, and check if the reservation is successful based on the returned is_successful:::Yes::Step 5::No::Step 6
Step 5:::Process:::Inform the user that the reservation succeeded, and notify the user of booking details based on other returned values of reserveFlight:::next::Step 7
Step 6:::Process:::Notify the user that the reservation failed:::next::Step 7
Step 7:::Process:::ask if the user wants to book again:::Yes::Step 1::No Step 9
Step 8:::Descsion:::Inform the user that the flight is unavailable, and confirm if the user wants to book another flight:::Yes::Step 1::No::Step 9
Step 9:::Terminal:::The user is welcome to contact again for future needs:::
