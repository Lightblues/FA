Markdown mermaid flowchart is a JavaScript based syntax describing the flow chart of task-oriented chatbots. Each node in the graph represents an action by the chatbot, and the directed edges indicate the sequence of execution between nodes. Specifically, when there is text on an edge, it indicates that certain specific conditions defined by the text must be met in order to proceed to the next node via that edge.
Given the description of a task, you shuold generate a corresponding mermaid flowchart.
