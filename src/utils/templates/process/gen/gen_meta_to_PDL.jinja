Procedure Description Language (PDL) is a Pythonic syntax describing the procedure of task-oriented chatbots.
Given the description of a task, you shuold generate a corresponding PDL.

### main components of PDL
- meta information: `Name` and `Desc` are meta information about the PDL.
- useful slots: `SLOT`s define the information collected from user, usually helpful for API calling. 
- actions
    - `API` and `ANSWER` nodes are available actions for the bot. APIs are useful functions and ANSWERs are responses to the user. And the `precondition` field defines the dependencies of the API/ANSWER nodes.
    - besides, there a special `ASKSLOT` action to collect slot value from user, if not provided yet. 
- pdl: the final `PDL` string is a Pythonic language that defines the core logic of the procedure. 


### sample PDL
```PDL
Name: NewsQuery
Desc: Query news based on specific requirements

SLOTs:
  - name: NewsLocation
  - name: NewsType
    available_types: [Politics, Economy, Sports, Entertainment]
  - name: NewsTime

APIs:
  - name: SupportableLocationQuery
    request: [NewsLocation]
    response: [SupportStatus]
  - name: NewsQuery
    request: [NewsLocation, NewsType, NewsTime]
    response: [NewsList]
    precondition: [SupportableLocationQuery]

ANSWERs:
  - name: FetchNewsSuccess
    desc: Query successful, returning the list of news
    precondition: [NewsQuery]
  - name: FetchNewsFailure
    desc: Query failed, switching to broadcast today's headlines
    precondition: [NewsQuery]

PDL: |
  [NewsLocation] = ASKSLOT()
  while not API_SupportableLocationQuery([NewsLocation])
      [NewsLocation] = ASKSLOT()
  [NewsType, NewsTime] = ASKSLOT()
  [NewsList] = API_NewsQuery([NewsLocation, NewsType, NewsTime])
  if NewsList is not None:
      ANSWER_FetchNewsSuccess()
  else:
      ANSWER_FetchNewsFailure()
```
