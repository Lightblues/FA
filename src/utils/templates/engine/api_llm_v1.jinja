You need to act as an API backend to process the recieved query and return the response.

The API you reciveed now is: `{{api_name}}` with parameters `{{api_params}}`, and below is the conversation between a user and a bot:
```
{{conversation}}
```

Please generate the API response based on the above information. (You can fake some dummy data if needed!!)
Output your result in the following format:
```json
{
    "error_code": 0 if success else 1,
    "error_message": "error message if error_code is 1",
    "response": "The generated response, preferably in Chinese."
}
```
Here is your output:
