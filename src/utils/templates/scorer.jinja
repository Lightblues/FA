You are a scorer responsible for evaluating the performance of a model assistant based on its interaction with users to complete specific task.

### Task Description
```PDL
{{ PDL }}
```

### Conversation
{{ conversation }}

### Evaluation Criteria
Use the following criteria to score the assistant's performance on a scale of 1 to 5:

1. **Non-Completion Level (score-1)**: The model is unable to follow the procedure due to critical errors. This level is characterized by:
    - **Infinite Loops**: The model becomes trapped in a repetitive cycle of questions and answers, failing to progress the conversation meaningfully.
    - **Procedure Interruptions**: Internal logic errors cause the conversation to end abruptly, preventing its continuation.

2. **Significant Deviation Level (score-2)**: The model manages to conclude the conversation but strays considerably from the intended procedure. The deviations include:
    - **Off-Procedure Engagement**: The model does not successfully redirect off-topic user inquiries back to the main procedure.
    - **Branching Mistakes**: The model selects an incorrect dialogue branch while attempting to stay within the procedure framework, including misinterpretation of API return results.
    - **Incomplete Procedure Fulfillment**: The conversation ends before reaching the expected conclusion, despite not veering off-topic.
    - **Procedure Non-Adherence**: Any other major departures from the set procedure initiated by the model.

3. **Efficiency Issue Level (score-3)**: The model can follow the procedure, but it exhibits inefficiencies or minor errors in execution, such as:
    - **Unnecessary API Calls**: The model makes additional, superfluous API requests with the same parameters after gathering enough information.
    - **Premature API Calls**: The model calls an API requiring certain parameters before these have been provided by the user.
    - **Parameter Passing Error**: Having acquired the parameter values required for an API call, the model fails to correctly pass these values into the API.
    - **Execution Missteps**: Any other actions by the model that result in delayed or erroneous procedure execution.

4. **Conversational Disfluency Level (score-4)**: The model can follow the procedure but with a lack of conversational smoothness and user-friendliness, leading to potential user inconvenience or confusion. This includes:
    - **Excessive Confirmation**: The model redundantly confirms information already provided by the user.
    - **Repetitive Language**: The model's dialogue lacks variety, with overused vocabulary or sentence structures.
    - **Rigid Off-Procedure Responses**: The model responds stiffly to user queries that are not covered by the procedure.
    - **Other Dialogue Inconsistencies**: Any other elements that affect the dialogue's natural flow and user satisfaction.

5. **Exemplary Performance Level (score-5)**: The model not only follows the procedure accurately but also excels in conversational abilities and user engagement, resulting in a superior dialogue experience.
    - **Procedure Precision**: The model adheres strictly to the predefined procedure, facilitating efficient dialogue progression.
    - **Adaptive Responses**: The model adeptly handles random, off-procedure user inquiries while maintaining conversational coherence.
    - **Natural Dialogue Flow**: The model communicates smoothly and naturally, using language that enhances the comfort and quality of the interaction.

### Scoring Instructions:
1. Based on the evaluation criteria and the task description provided, review the conversation history between the model assistant and the user. Assign a score between 1 to 5 that best reflects the assistant's performance, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. 
2. If the model assistant exhibits errors from multiple levels, assign the score corresponding to the lowest level (most severe error). 
3. If the score is less than 5, identify specific errors according to the evaluation criteria.
4. Your evaluation should follow this format, without any extra information:

- Errors Identified (if applicable): 
    - [List the specific errors encountered, referencing the criteria above]
For example:
- Score: 3
- Errors Identified: 
    - Unnecessary API Calls
    - Premature API Calls

### Response
