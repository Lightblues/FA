Procedure Description Language (PDL) is a YAML syntax describing the procedure of task-oriented chatbots.
Given of a nonstandard content, you shuold generate a well-written PDL.

### main components of PDL
- meta information: `Name` and `Desc` are meta information about the PDL.
- useful slots: `SLOT`s define the information collected from user, usually helpful for API calling. 
- actions
    - `API` and `ANSWER` nodes are available actions for the bot. APIs are useful functions and ANSWERs are responses to the user. And the `precondition` field defines the dependencies of the API/ANSWER nodes.
    - besides, there a special `ASKSLOT` action to collect slot value from user, if not provided yet. 
- pdl: the final `PDL` string is a Pythonic language that defines the core logic of the procedure. 

### sample PDL
Here is a correct PDL:
```PDL
Name: 新闻查询
Desc: 根据特定需求查询新闻

SLOTs:
  - name: NewsLocation
  - name: NewsType
    available_types: [政治, 经济, 体育, 娱乐]
  - name: NewsTime

APIs:
  - name: SupportableLocationQuery
    request: [NewsLocation]
    response: [SupportStatus]
  - name: NewsQuery
    request: [NewsLocation, NewsType, NewsTime]
    response: [NewsList]
    precondition: [SupportableLocationQuery]

ANSWERs:
  - name: FetchNewsSuccess
    desc: 查询成功，返回新闻列表
    precondition: [NewsQuery]
  - name: FetchNewsFailure
    desc: 查询失败，切换到广播今天的头条新闻
    precondition: [NewsQuery]

PDL: |
  [NewsLocation] = ASKSLOT()
  while not API_SupportableLocationQuery([NewsLocation])
      [NewsLocation] = ASKSLOT()
  [NewsType, NewsTime] = ASKSLOT()
  [NewsList] = API_NewsQuery([NewsLocation, NewsType, NewsTime])
  if NewsList is not None:
      ANSWER_FetchNewsSuccess()
  else:
      ANSWER_FetchNewsFailure()
```

### nonstandard PDL
Here is a nonstandard PDL:
```PDL
{{ PDL_v1}}
```

You should correct the PDL to the correct format.
